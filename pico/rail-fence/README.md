This challlenge is about decrypting message.txt.

## Solution

I put the message into a online decryptor

Link to dectyptor: https://www.dcode.fr/rail-fence-cipher

When we do that we get `The·flag·is:·WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_D00AFDD3`

All we have to do is wrap the flag in picoCTF{}

Flag: `picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_D00AFDD3}`
