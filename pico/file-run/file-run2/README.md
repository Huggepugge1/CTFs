This challenge straight up gives you the answer. How to run the file was covered in the last challenge so I won't be covering that here. When you run the file you get the output `Run this file with only one argument.`. I tried running the file like `./run kjasdf` but got `Won't you say 'Hello!' to me first?` as the output. Then I ran the script with the argument `Hello!` and got the flag.
