This challenge is about finding information in big files. The trick is to use some sort of tool for searching for strings.

Solution:
Grep: `cat anthem.flag.txt |  grep picoCTF`
awk: `awk '/picoCTF/ { print }' anthem.flag.txt`
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

with open("anthem.flag.txt", "r") as f:
    while f:
        line = f.readline()
        if "picoCTF" in line:
            print(line)
            exit(0)
```

Flag: `picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_2116b979}`
